Unit test:

1. Instantiate an object of the class you wish to test
2. Set any necessary instance variables on that class to create the test condition
3. Call the method/s you wish to test
4. Compare the expected value/s with the actual value, print success if they match, fail if they do not
5. Repeat for all conditions.


For Project 3:
Test area calculation: need length and width
Test Season charge: need length, width 
Test service charge: need # of payments
